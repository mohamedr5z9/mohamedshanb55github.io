        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iam a Penetration Tester with practical experience in Network Penetration
Testing, Active Directory Assessments, and Web Application Testing. I am proficient in using a range of security
tools such as Nessus, BloodHound, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Nikto, Hydra, Aircrack-ng, John the
Ripper, WiFi-Pumpkin, and SQLmap to identify, analyze, and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
In addition to my penetration testing skills, I hold a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification, which
has provided me with a strong foundation in network fundamentals, IP services, security, automation, and
programmability. I am proficient in configuring and troubleshooting Cisco devices, enhancing network efficiency,
reliability, and security across enterprise systems.
I also have significant experience working with Fortinet security solutions, including configuring and managing
FortiGate devices, implementing firewall policies, and ensuring comprehensive network security at the enterprise level. I
am passionate about improving cybersecurity and eager to expand my knowledge and skills in penetration testing,
network security, and threat mitigation.</p>
